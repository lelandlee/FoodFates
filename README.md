Fates of Food
=====================
By the Oracle of Yelp Datasets

Front end of the app. From 6Sense's datahack 2015.
Backend = https://github.com/joygao/RestfulFlaskyStuff.

Todo (frontend side):
* Have React / flux integration -> had some issues with integration...
* Have tooltips for the heatmap -> otherwise it only shows density
* Toggling to show different types of restaurants within the heatmap
* What would be interesting overlays?
    - Weighted Voronoi or multi layer voronoi
    - Color coding specific node groups
    - Finding some sort of ontology? or heirarchy within the categories
    - Finding closest competetors
* Use map for data exploration rather than simple presentation 

Data Science / Backend:
* Optimal location for specific types of restuarants / eateries
